## *Description*
Presenting a well-crafted README.md file with your GitHub project is the first step in communicating that project to other developers and potential employers. However, these project summaries can take quite a bit of time to type up and format correctly - time that could be better spent building your application.

Using a command line markdown generator removes the extra formatting steps, leaving you with a polished end product that includes all the essentials.

## *Installation*
`npm i inquirer` on the command line in root folder.

## *Usage*
Type `node index.js` in the terminal, then go through the prompts, pressing `ENTER` after each response.
